Try as you may, change cannot be controlled.
People have a way of fighting through the pain of change when they want the outcome badly enough.

Your change doesn't begin on the start date written on your Gantt chart. It begins when people are whispering at the watercooler.

## The commission

It's human nature to label someone as being resistant to change when they don't do what we want them to. As a CHange Agent, it's never about you, or me - it's about understanding the perspective of the people affected by change. People may be afraid of the loss that comes with change, but may also just not understand the reason behind the change.

### Pirate Metrics
- Achquisition: get new customer
- Activation: the new customer signs-up and use the product
- Retention: the customer comes back and uses it again
- Referral: the customer shares the product with their friends
- Revenue: the customer pays for your product

Process helps make sens of change but blindly following a process is a recipe for disaster.

PCDA - Plan, Do, Check, Act.

Review the outcomes sorted in 3 columns:
- Pursue: meant htat the change worked and we should keep doing similar changes.
- Pivot: Meant that the change sorta worked, but something about it required tweaking.
- Abandon: well.. forget it.

Color your action in red first, see how the implementation goes and turn it green it it's going well.
Start with red, otherwise it will stay green until the very last minute when you get the negative feedback.

### Lean change management cycle

1. Insights
   Before you can plan any change, you need to understand the current state of the organization. (ex: ADKAR, Lean coffee)
2. Options
   Once you have gained enought insights, start planning options. Options have a cost, value and impact.
   Prioritize your options bu value/cost (2 dimension graph can help)
3. Experiments
   At this point you've learned enough about your current state and considered multiple Options. Now it's time to introduce a change and see if it works out the way you thought it would.
4. Prepare
   This is the planning stage of your experiment. The key point about the prepare step is that at this point, all you have are your assumptions about the change. This is in this step that you validate your approach with the people affected by the change before you implement it.
5. Introduce
   You start working with the people affected by the change. Once a change has reached this step, it's considered to be in process. Ideally you will be limiting the number of changes happening at the same time.
6. Review
   Here you review the outcomes of the Experiment.

### Adkar

Awareness: need for the change
Desire: to participate and support the change
Knowledge: on how to change
Ability: to implement required skills and behaviors
Reinforcement: to sustain the change

Read: Behing Closed Doors.

Ideas: create a timeslot like lean coffee for any team member to come and discuss what they want. It is part of my time I offer them.

## Insights

Plan become obsolete so quickly because there is too much emphasis on trying to create a perfect change plan. When the stakeholders and change team spend too much time planning, they run the risk of convincing themselves that the plan is perfect. Then they hit a wall of change resistance when they put the plan into practice.
If it took them three months to plan the change, the stakeholders and the change team will have a three month head start understanding and processing all the details of the plan. The people affected by the change need at least as much time, if not more, to catch up.

!Having a plan is important but breaking it down into smaller chunks and releasing those changes to the organization slowly is more important.

### Generating insights

Disruptive innovation is good, disruption  for the sake of disruption is not.

1. Information radiators, make your work visible on the wall like a Kanban board
2. Insights door, give a room (on the wall) for people to add recommendations, ask questions,..
3. Lean coffee, is a "meeting" with formal meeting invites, anyone can come and bring the subject they want, this increase transparency and can help a lot gaining insights on frustration, early adopters,...
How to lead Lean coffe (same generation and selection of topics as in the Open Space sessions)
4. Cukture hacking, more about it further.
5. Agile retrospective, 
6. Kurt Lewin Force Field Analysis.

#### Culture hacking
  - The crack is an organizational dysfunction that feeds uncomfortable. It generates tension, frustration or bad vibes.
  - The hack is the action you take to point out the crack in the organization. It's a minimal artful intervention , which if succesful, exploits the crack to influence the culture of an organization. The hack is something you do to expose the reality that you see to the people who simply see the status quo. 
  By exposing that reality in a tactful way, you will open their eyes and make them aware of the dysfunction.
  Exemple: Phone storage box, tell the people they can put their phone in the box or leave the meeting.
  Be mindful of your hack impacts.
  - Green zone: gentle kick in the organization butt, that will safely help an organization become self-aware.
  - Blue zone: these hacks can get you hauled into the boss' office for a lecture or worse.
  - Red zone: these are the most disruptive and can lead to potentially needing to update your resume, they can also severly harm the company.  

#### Retro about change

! It can be useful to make a retro about a change and then provide the result as a feedback to the people promoting and making the change.

#### Force Field Analysis

Take a sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle. On one side, write all the forces pushing against or restraining the change. On the other side, write all the forces supporting or driving the change.
You can assign to each force a strenght score (from 1 to 5).

Then you can have an overall view of the change and which direction is the strongest.

Top-down change without honest feedback from those affected by the change simply will not work. By using Force Field analysis , we provide a safe feedback mechanism for teams because the data was anonymous, and we provided the executives with useful information they could use to adjust the strategy.

#### Assessements that generates Insights

##### ADKAR

Adkar has two dimension the business and the people dimension.

Business dimension:
- Business need: the business need and opportunity are identified
- Concept and design: creating the plan for a change process, including scope and objectives
- Implementing: executing the change
- Post-implementation: this step is comprised of the usual project post-implementation activities like project close-out and post-mortem.

Once you created Awareness and Desire , that doesn't mean everyone in the organization is at the same leveland they are ready to acquire knowledge.

##### OCAI
Organizational Culture Assessement Instrument

OCAI defines 4 culture types:
- Clan: Internally focused, values flexibility and freedom
- Hierarchy: Internally focused, values stability and control
- Adhocracy: Externally focused, values flexibility and freedom
- Market: Externally focused, values stability and control

##### Schneider Culture Model
From the book Re-engineering alternative: a plan for making your current company culture work

- Collaboration: "We succeed by working together"
- Control: "We succeed by etablishing  and maintaining control"
- Cultivation: "We succeed by growing our people"
- Competence: "We succeed by being the best"

## Frameworks

### Kotter's 8 step Change Model
- Create urgency
- Form a powerful coalition
- Create a vision for the change
Think of the vision as your 30-second elevator pitch for the change. this vision must be specific, measurable, actionable, inspriring and realistic. See the vision as a Lighthouse that we want to reach.
- Communicate the Vision
- Relove Obstacles
- Create short term wins
To build up on the change and to keep motivation
- Build on the change
- Anchor the change in Corporate Culture 

McKinsey 7S Framework

- Strategy
- Structure
- Systems
- Shared values
- Skills
- Style
- Staff

Domino effect, a change in one area of an organization has consequences to other areas.

Trying to apply a Structured change process is one of the cause of change failures.
A plan is needed, but it needs to be adapted constantly according to the insights and feedbacks.

## Options

Rate your options on a graph with x-axis being the cost and y-axis being the value. From this graph, select the options that you will add in the backlog of changes and keep the other ones as ideas for a potential future.

### Blast radius
https://idealeap.com/downloads

Which departments, people and management roles are directly and indirectly affected by the change.

### Sphere of Influence
Understand where support for the change will come from.

To classify your options, think about the impacts and questions coming from McKinsey 7S, ADKAR and Kotter's 8-steps.

### Manage change with Kanban

4 columns: Abandon, Yikes!, Do later, Do now
3 rows: Training, Communication, Process changes

Don't forget to share and make visible your change plan

## Experiments

### Create Hypotheses for experiments

Think about:
- What the Experiment would be
- Who would be affected
- What the benefit would be
- How to validate the Experiment as successful

#### Template

We hypothesize by "implementing this change"
we will "solve this problem"
which will have "these benefits"
as leasured by "this measurement"

### Validating experiments 

#### Before the experiment:
How will we know this Experiment has been successful?
How will we know we are moving towars our intended outcome?

#### After

- Did the people affected by the change get the outcome they thought they would?
- Has this experiment improved something for them or made them happier?

### Improvement Canvas
The format of your canvas matters less than the conversation that creates it.

4 steps of the improvement kata:
- Understand the direction
- Grasp the current condition
- Etablish the target condition
- PDCA (Plan, do, check, act)

-> Check: One page change plan

Always encourage feedback!

### Measuring experiments

! What get measured, gets managed !

Be careful about how you measure progress because it'll influence behavior.
-> Separate measurements from diagnostics

## Creating Alignment for Change

- Develop your strategic change canvas
- Align your organization
- Develop your change agent network
- Execute the lean change management cycle

-> Check: Strategic change canvas / Departement change canvas

Change goes viral when people start helping other people adjust
