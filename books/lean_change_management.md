Try as you may, change cannot be controlled.
People have a way of fighting through the pain of change when they want the outcome badly enough.

Your change doesn't begin on the start date written on your Gantt chart. It begins when people are whispering at the watercooler.

## The commission

It's human nature to label someone as being resistant to change when they don't do what we want them to. As a CHange Agent, it's never about you, or me - it's about understanding the perspective of the people affected by change. People may be afraid of the loss that comes with change, but may also just not understand the reason behind the change.

### Pirate Metrics
- Achquisition: get new customer
- Activation: the new customer signs-up and use the product
- Retention: the customer comes back and uses it again
- Referral: the customer shares the product with their friends
- Revenue: the customer pays for your product

Process helps make sens of change but blindly following a process is a recipe for disaster.

PCDA - Plan, Do, Check, Act.

Review the outcomes sorted in 3 columns:
- Pursue: meant htat the change worked and we should keep doing similar changes.
- Pivot: Meant that the change sorta worked, but something about it required tweaking.
- Abandon: well.. forget it.

Color your action in red first, see how the implementation goes and turn it green it it's going well.
Start with red, otherwise it will stay green until the very last minute when you get the negative feedback.

1. Insights
   Before you can plan any change, you need to understand the current state of the organization. (ex: ADKAR, Lean coffee)
2. Options
   Once you have gained enought insights, start planning options. Options have a cost, value and impact.
   Prioritize your options bu value/cost (2 dimension graph can help)
3. Experiments
   At this point you've learned enough about your current state and considered multiple Options. Now it's time to introduce a change and see if it works out the way you thought it would.
4. Prepare
   This is the planning stage of your experiment. The key point about the prepare step is that at this point, all you have are your assumptions about the change. This is in this step that you validate your approach with the people affected by the change before you implement it.
5. Introduce
   You start working with the people affected by the change. Once a change has reached this step, it's considered to be in process. Ideally you will be limiting the number of changes happening at the same time.
6. Review
   Here you review the outcomes of the Experiment.

### Adkar

Awareness: need for the change
Desire: to participate and support the change
Knowledge: on how to change
Ability: to implement required skills and behaviors
Reinforcement: to sustain the change

Ideas: create a timeslot like lean coffee for any team member to come and discuss what they want. It is part of my time I offer them.

## Insights

Plan become obsolete so quickly because there is too much emphasis on trying to create a perfect change plan. When the stakeholders and change team spend too much time planning, they run the risk of convincing themselves that the plan is perfect. Then they hit a wall of change resistance when they put the plan into practice.
If it took them three months to plan the change, the stakeholders and the change team will have a three month head start understanding and processing all the details of the plan. The people affected by the change need at least as much time, if not more, to catch up.

!Having a plan is important but breaking it down into smaller chunks and releasing those changes to the organization slowly is more important.

### Generating insights

Disruptive innovation is good, disruption  for the sake of disruption is not.

1. Information radiators, make your work visible on the wall like a Kanban board
2. Insights door, give a room (on the wall) for people to add recommendations, ask questions,..
3. Lean coffee, is a "meeting" with formal meeting invites, anyone can come and bring the subject they want, this increase transparency and can help a lot gaining insights on frustration, early adopters,...
How to lead Lean coffe (same generation and selection of topics as in the Open Space sessions)
4. Cukture hacking, more about it further.
5. Agile retrospective, 
6. Kurt Lewin Force Field Analysis.

#### Culture hacking
  - The crack is an organizational dysfunction that feeds uncomfortable. It generates tension, frustration or bad vibes.
  - The hack is the action you take to point out the crack in the organization. It's a minimal artful intervention , which if succesful, exploits the crack to influence the culture of an organization. The hack is something you do to expose the reality that you see to the people who simply see the status quo. 
  By exposing that reality in a tactful way, you will open their eyes and make them aware of the dysfunction.
  Exemple: Phone storage box, tell the people they can put their phone in the box or leave the meeting.
  Be mindful of your hack impacts.
  - Green zone: gentle kick in the organization butt, that will safely help an organization become self-aware.
  - Blue zone: these hacks can get you hauled into the boss' office for a lecture or worse.
  - Red zone: these are the most disruptive and can lead to potentially needing to update your resume, they can also severly harm the company.
