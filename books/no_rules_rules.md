# No Rules rules

## Resume

Netflix culture
> People over process, emphasized innovation over efficiency, and very few controls.
Lead employees with context, not control.

* Check Netflix Culture deck powerpoint

There are 2 pre-requisite to reduce controls:
- Build up talent density, rules are often there to deal with sloppy, unprofessional or irresponsible behaviors.
- Increase candor, foster feedback and learning from each other.

Note: If someone is doing his job poorly, people will probably find a way to work around it that leads to two problems, good people are busy doing something else than their job, and that one guy doesn't get feedback and the chance to become better, in short you lose one worker fully, and partially the others working around him. Solution: address the problem.

Every unsolved problem cost money to the company everyday.

### A4 Feedback

- Aim to Assist, clearly explain how a behaviour change will help the individual or the company, not how it will help you.
- Actionable, focus on what the recipient can do differently.
- Appreciate, show appreciation for the feedback you got.
- Accept or discard, you must listen and consider but you are free to follow it or not.

"Never give criticism when you are still angry"

### Remove Control

Today, in the information age, what matters is what you achieve, not how many hours you clock, especially for the employees of creative companies like Netflix.
When it comes to how we judge performance at Netflix, hard work is irrelevant.

The Netflix culture has great ideas but sometimes the gap between the ideals and practice is big and what should bridge that gap is leadership. When leaders don't set a good example...

"What we say as leaders is only half the equation, our employees are also looking at what we do.
If I say 'I want you to find a sustainable and healthy work-life balance' but I'm in the office twelve hours a day, people will imitate my actions, not follow my words"

### Remove travel and expense approvals

"When I saw how senior management spend their time, I lost confidence in the company"

At Netflix, I didnt want anyone wasting time on this type of discussion. More so, I didn't want our talented employees to feel that dumb rules were preventing them from using their brains to do what was the best. This was a clear way to kill the creative vibes that make for an innovative workplace.

Real life is so much more nuanced than any policy could ever address.

"Act in Netflix best interest"

Abuse the freedom and you are out, and you need to fire them loudly so others understand the ramifications. Without this, freedom doesn't work.
If some people cheat the system, don't overreact and create more rules, just deal with the individual situation and move forward.

If you limit your employees choices by making them check boxes and ask for permission, you won't just frustrate them, you will lose out on the speed and flexibility that comes from a low-rule environment.

When you set rules, people will look eagerly for a way to take advantage of them. The organization with the policy is not necessarily the one saving money.

All these rules meant that going to work was less fun- and our most maverick employees, who were also the most innovative, left the company for more entrepreneurial environments. Those who chose to stay preferred familiarity and consistency. They learned policy adherence as the ultimate value. I realized during those long runs with Tristan that at Pure Software  we had, without much thought, dummy-proofed the work environment. The result was that only dummies wanted to work here (well, not really dummies, but you get what I mean).

Instead of putting more efforts and time to create more rules and procedures, we would continue to do two other things: increase talent density and new ways to increase candor.

### Pay top of personal market

We determined that for any type of operational role, where there was a clear cap on how good the work could be, we would pay middle of market rate. But for all creative jobs we would pay one incredible employee at the top of her personal market, instead of using that same money to hire a dozen or more adequate performers.

Managing mediocre-performing employees is harder and more time consuming. By keeping our organisation small and out teams lean, each manager has fewer people to manage and can therefore do a better job at it. When those lean teams are exclusively made up of exceptional performing employees, the managers do better, the employees do better, and the entire team works better and faster.

On long term KPI, The risk is that employees will focus on a target instead of spot what's best for the company in the present moment.

On salary bonus based on performance, "I have no idea why I was offered a contract with a bonus in it because I promise you I will not work any harder or any less hard in any year, in any day because someone is going to pay me more or less"

At most companies, negotiating a salary is like buying a used car. You want the job, but you don't know the maximum the company is willing to compensate, so you try to guess what to ask for and what to accept. The company uses your ignorance to hire you at the lowest salary possible. This is a great way to get an employee for less than she's worth, only to have her spirited away to another company at a higher price point a few months later.

Keep any precise information about salary close to the chest.

So it's paradoxical that when it comes to adjusting salaries, just about every company on earth follows a system that's likely to decrease talent density by encouraging people to find a job elsewhere.

Research confirms what you already suspected. You'll get more money if you change companies than if you stay put. In 2018 the average annual pay raise per employee in the US was about 3 percent (5 percent for top perfomers). For an employee quitting her job and joining a new company, the average raise was between 10 percent and 20 percent.

Netflix already offered 3 times the salary of one employee joining them, and the year after a raise of 23% to keep him up on top of market rate.

Note: It is a bit like Dreamland used to do, if you find cheaper elsewhere, we pay you back the difference, but here at Netflix it is, if someone pays you more and you can prove it with data, we will raise you.

It is best to have salaries a little higher than necessary, to give a raise before an employee asks for it, to bump up a salary before that employee starts looking for another job, in order to attract and retain the best talent on the market year after year.

### Open the books

How can you trust someone when you feel they are hiding things from you?
> I was blown away by his comfort with bringing everything out in the open. I felt trust for him in a way I had never so quickly experienced. That friendshop was transformative for me, because I saw that letting go of secrets and speaking transparently brought incredible advantages.

SOS - Stuff of secrets
Some kind of secrets you still should keep:
- You are considerint a reorganization and people might lose their jobs
- You've fired an employee but explaining why would hurt his reputation
- You have "secret sauce" information you don't want to leak out to your competitors
- You made a mistake that could hurt your reputation, maybe ruin your career
- Two leaders are in conflict, and if their teams knew it, it would lead to unrest
- Employees could go to jail if they share certain financial data with a friend

> I always try to go to the work spot of the person I'm seeing instead of making them come to me.
Any locked area is symbolic of hidden things and signifies we don't trust one another.

This guy managed to instigate feelings of ownership by guiding people to understand the reasons behind the work they are doing. I don't want my employees to feel like they're working for Netflix; I want them to feel like they are part of Netflix. That's when I decided, if you're going to work at Netflix, no one is going to hold an umbrella over your head. 
You're going to get wet.

When you give low-level employees access to information that is generally reserved for high-level executives, they get more done on their own. They work faster without stopping to ask for information and approval. They make better decision without needing input from the top.

Although just about all companies talk about empowering staff, in vast majority of organzations, real empowerment is a pipe dream because employees aren't given enough information to take ownership of anything.

"If we suddenly begin keeping financial data from employees, what would it symbolize? that our employees were outsiders in their own company

!!! Do not punish the majority for the poor bejavior of a few !!!

### No decision-making approvals needed

The difference is the decision making freedom we provide. If your employees are excellent and you give them freedom to implement the bright they believe in, innovation will happen.
We are in a creative market. Our big threat in the long run is not making a mistake, it's lack of innovation. Our risk is failing to come up with creative ideas.

If you hope for more innovation on your team, teach employees to seek ways to move the business forward, not ways to please their boss.

Netflix innovation cycle:
1. Farm for dissent "or" socialize the idea
2. For a big idea, test it out
3. As the informed captain, make your bet
4. If it succeeds, celebrate. If it fails, sunshine it.

It is disloyal to Netflix when you disagree with an idea and do no express that disagreement. By withholding your opinion, you are implicitly choosing to not help the company.

This is one of the potential reason why many korean plane crashed in the 80's

#### Farm for dissent

To make the best decision, you need input from a lot of people. Before taking major decisions, actively seek out different perspectives.

To gather different perspectiv, share a page and ask people to comment it and rate it (to know how dissident they are about the idea).

#### Socialize the idea

For smaller initiatives, you don't need to farm for dissent, but you'd still be wise to let everyone know what you're doing and to take the temperature of your initiative.

#### For a big idea, test it out

Do experiments or interviews to proove that an idea is good or not

#### As the informed captain place your bet

The four step innovation cycle is individual decision-making with input.

The informed captain is solely responsible for the decision. At most companies all important contracts are signed by someone high up in the organization.

> The person who is living and breathing the contract needs to be the person who owns and signs the contract, not a head of function or a VP. That takes responsability of the project away from the person who should be responsible. Camille is proud of what she accomplished. This is her thing not mine. She is psychologicaly invested, and I want to keep her that way. I'm not going to take ownership away from her by putting my name on the deal.

> One of the reason I left Yahoo was that I didn't feel ownership for anything. Even thought I might have come up with an idea and started the initiative, by the time it got approved by everyone and his mother it didn't feel like mine any more. If it crashed, I'd feel: "Well, thirty other people agreed, it's not my fault".
> I learned that getting it perfect doesn't matter. What matters is moving quickly and learning from what we're doing. I'm at a place where I can take responsibility for my own decision.

#### If it wins, celebrate it; if it fails, sunshine it

The one thing you must do is show, ideally in public, that you are pleased she went ahead despite your doubts and offer a clear 'You were right, I was wrong" to show all employees it's ok to buck the opinion of the boss.

If it failed:
1. Ask what learning came from the project
2. Don't make a big deal about it
3. Ask her to "sunshine" the failure

If you don't do this and everyone on the team will know that "don't seek to please your boss" is a joke.

"Complexity kills consumer engagement"

When a bet fails, the manager must be careful to express interest in the takeaways but no condemnation. Everyone in that room left with two major messages in mind. First, if you take a bet and it fails, Reed will ask you what you learned. Second, if you try out something big and it doesn't work out, nobody will scream and you won't lose your job.

- When new employees join the company, tell them they have a handful of metaphorical chips that they can make bets with. Some gambles will succeed, and some will fail. A worker's performance will be judged on the collective outcome of his bets, not on the results from one single instance.

## Techniques to reinforce a culture of freedom and responsibility

### The keeper test

No matter how careful you are, sometimes you will make hiring mistakes, sometimes people won't grow as much as you had hoped, and sometimes your company's needs change. To achieve the highest level of talent density you have to be prepared to make tough calls. If you are serious about talent density, you have to get in the habit of doing something a lot harder: firing a good employee when you think you can get a great one.
A high-talent-density work environment is not a family. Business leaders should not tell their employees that "We are a family".
-> A family is about staying together regardless of 'performance'

The family represents belonging, comfort and commitment to helping on another over the long term.

Once you stop learning or stop excelling, that's the moment for you to pass that spot onto someone who is better fitted for it and to move on to a better role for you.

We are a team, not a family
In pro, or Olympic sports team, the players understand the coach's role is to upgrade- if necessary- to move from good to great.
For people who value job security over winning championships, Netflix is not the right choice, and we try to be clear and non-judgmental about that.

The keeper test
We ask the manager: Would the company be better off if you let go of Samuel and looked for someone more effective? If they say 'yes' that's a clear sign that it is time to look for another player.

> If a person on your team were to quit tomorrow, would you try to change their mind? Or would you accept their resignation, perhaps with a little relief? If the latter, you should give them a severance package now, and look for a star, someone you would fight to keep.

Adequate performance gets a generous severance package.

If you are worried about losing your job, ask your boss
> If I were thinking of leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind?

Average voluntary turnover is 12% and 6% involuntary.
For technology companies, the total average turnover is more like 13%.

-> Avoid stack-ranking systems, as they create internal competition and discourage collaboration.

-> When you realize you need to let someone go, instead of putting him on some type of PIP, which is humiliating and organizationally costly, take all that money and give it to the employee in the form of a generous severance payment.

-> When an employee is let go, speak openly about what happened with your staff and answer their questions candidly. This will diminish their fear of being next and increase their trust in the company and its managers.

 ### A circle of feedback

 Stop avoiding conflict within the team, it simply festers elsewhere and comes back bigger. Address them directly.

 Do 360 feedback live, do it over dinner and keeo the group small.
 Positive actionable feedback is fine, but keep it in check. A good mix is 25 percent positive and 75 percent developmental (start/stop doing). Any nonactionable fluff ('I think you are a great colleague' or 'I love working with you') should be discouraged and stamped out.

 ### Lead with context, not control

Leadership with control is familiar to most. The boss approves and directs the initiatives, actions and decisions of the team. Sometimes she may control employees' decisions throught direct oversight- telling them what to do, checking in frequently, and correcting any work that isn't done as she desires.

 Many Leaders frequently use control processes to give the employee some freedom to approach a task as he chooses, while still allowing the boss an opportunity to control what gets done and when.

 Leading with context, gives considerably more freedom to employees. You provide all of the information you can so that your team members make great decisions and accomplish their work without oversight or process controlling their actions.
 The benefit is that the person builds the decision-making muscle to make better independent decisions in the future.

 Leading with control makes it uncomfortable to take initiatives

 Me: In leading with control, you reduce risk and benefits for the profit of being more predictable/normal.
 The choice of leading techniques is dependent of talent density but also on the domain and errors that you can afford or the creativity that you need.

 To encourage original thinking, don't tell your employees what to do and make them check boxes.
 Give them the context to dream big, the inspiration to think differently, and the space to make mistakes along the way. In other words, lead with context.

 > Si tu veux construire un bateau, ne rassemble pas tes hommes et femmes pour leur donner des ordres, pour expliquer chaque détail, pour leur dire où trouver chaque chose... Si tu veux construire un bateau, fais naître dans le cœur de tes hommes et femmes le désir de la mer.

There's a third prerequesite to lead with context: have a system that is loosely coupled.
In a loosely coupled, an individual manager or employee is free to make decisions or solve problems, safe in the knowledge that the consequences will not ricochet through other departements.

If the goals of your company are innovation and flexibility, try to keep decision-making decentralized, with few interdependencies between functions, in order to nurture loose coupling from the outset.

When one of your people does something dumb don't blame them, instead ask yourself what context you failed to set. Are you articulate and inspiring enough in expressing your goals and strategy? Have you clearly explained all the assumptions and risks that will help your team to make good decisions? Are you and your employees highly aligned on vision and objectives?

Prioritize flexibilty over error prevention

Vacations policies, travel policies, and expense policies can lead to the type of high-rule environment that discourages creative thinking and scare off most innovative employees.
Approval policies, decison making by committee and contract sign-off all put hurdles in front of your employees so that they can't move quickly.
Pay per performance bonuses, management by objective and KPI keep the organization from changing quickly by makng it difficult to quickly dump one project and pick another one.
