Scrum shines in complex domains where

Si projet fix price. Requirements sont clair?

product requirements are unclear.

Now as then, the reports become more important than the reality they’re supposed to describe, and if there’s a discrepancy, reality is the problem, not the charts.

Eisenhower once observed that planning for combat is important, but as soon as the first shot is fired, your plans go up in smoke. At

management wants two things on any project: control and predictability. This leads to vast numbers of documents and graphs and charts,

The problem is that the rosy scenario never actually unfolds. All that effort poured into planning, trying to restrict change, trying to know the unknowable is wasted. Every project involves discovery of problems and bursts of inspiration. Trying to restrict a human endeavor of any scope to color-coded charts and graphs is foolish and doomed to failure. It’s not how people work, and it’s not how projects progress. It’s not how ideas reach fruition or how great things are made.

Scrum embraces uncertainty and creativity. It places a structure around the learning process, enabling teams to assess both what they’ve created and, just as important, how they created it.

The cathedral at Chartres took fifty-seven years to build. It’s a safe bet that at the beginning of the project the stonemasons looked at the bishop and said, “Twenty years, max. Probably be done in fifteen.”

At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you start a project, why not regularly check in, see if what you’re doing is heading in the right direction, and if it’s actually what people want? And question whether there are any ways to improve how you’re doing what you’re doing, any ways of doing it better and faster, and what might be keeping you from doing that.

Companies that still cling to tried-but-not-true ideas of command and control and that attempt to impose rigid predictability are simply doomed to fail if their competitors use Scrum.

here, but one of the key concepts that Ohno introduced is the idea of “flow.” That is, production should flow swiftly and calmly throughout the process, and, he said, one of management’s key tasks is to identify and remove impediments to that flow. Everything that stands in the way is waste. Ohno gives waste a moral, as well as a business, value in his classic book, The Toyota Production System:

Eliminating waste must be a business’s first objective.

At the end of the Sprint, the team comes together and shows what they’ve accomplished during the time they’ve collaborated. They look at how many of those sticky notes they actually got done. Did they bring too many into the Sprint and not finish them all? Did they not bring enough? What’s important here is that they begin to have a baseline sense of how fast they can go—their velocity.

After they’ve shown what they’ve done—and here’s where Ohno’s ideas come in—they discuss not what they did, but how they did it.

smarter. Jeff Johnson says his teams increased

working better and smarter.

“Scrum is not about the developers. It’s about the customers and stakeholders. Really, it was an organizational change. Showing the actual product was the most powerful part.”

The problem was, everyone said, “Not my job.”

They delivered their piece and left it at that. They never looked at the site from the user’s point of view, merely from their own. The reason they could do that was that they weren’t aligned—weren’t united in a common purpose.

that requires everyone not only to see the end goal, but to deliver incrementally toward that goal.

How much of your life is wasted on work that both you and your boss realize doesn’t create value?

THE TAKEAWAY Planning Is Useful. Blindly Following Plans Is Stupid. It’s just so tempting to draw up endless charts. All the work needed to be done on a massive project laid out for everyone to see—but when detailed plans meet reality, they fall apart. Build into your working method the assumption of change, discovery, and new ideas. Inspect and Adapt. Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing, review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and if you can do it better. Change or Die. Clinging to the old way of doing things, of command and control and rigid predictability, will bring only failure. In the meantime, the competition that is willing to change will leave you in the dust. Fail Fast So You Can Fix Early. Corporate culture often puts more weight on forms, procedures, and meetings than on visible value creation that can be inspected at short intervals by users. Work that does not produce real value is madness. Working product in short cycles allows early user feedback and you can immediately eliminate what is obviously wasteful

Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.

… no matter how excellent your technicians, you who are leaders must strive for advances in the improvement of product quality and uniformity if your technicians are to be able to make improvements. The first step, therefore, belongs with management. First, your company technicians and your factories must know that you have a fervor for advancing product quality and uniformity and a sense of responsibility for product quality. Nothing will come of this if you only speak about it. Action is important.

Hesitation Is Death. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. Know where you are, assess your options, make a decision, and act! Look Outward for Answers. Complex adaptive systems follow a few simple rules, which they learn from their environment.

And when you examine how the teams did, you see something surprising. If the best team could perform a task in one week, how long do you think it took the worst team? You might guess the same ratio as was observed at Yale—10:1 (that is, the slow team took more than two months to accomplish what the fast team knocked off in a week). The actual answer, though, is that there is a much larger difference in team performance than there is in individual performance. It actually didn’t take the slow team ten weeks to do what the best team could do in one week. Rather, it took them two thousand weeks.

Transcendent: They have a sense of purpose beyond the ordinary. This self-realized goal allows them to move beyond the ordinary into the extraordinary. In a very real way the very decision to not be average, but to be great, changes the way they view themselves, and what they’re capable of. 2. Autonomous: The teams are self-organizing and self-managing, they have the power to make their own decisions about how they do their jobs, and are empowered to make those decisions stick. 3. Cross-Functional: The teams have all the skills needed to complete the project. Planning, design, production, sales, distribution. And those skills feed and reinforce each other. As one team member that designed a revolutionary new camera for Canon described it: “When all the team members are located in one large room, someone’s information becomes yours, without even trying. You then start thinking in terms of what’s best or second best for the group at large and not only where you stand.”1

I got heat for criticizing the commander, but I said simply in response, “The ratings are the ratings. I’m just showing you what they are. The ranks have pulled their shit together. You are now the problem. Do you want to fix it? Or do you want to suck forever?”

What she looks for in a team is diversity—of skill set, thinking, and experience. She wants teams that are unselfish and autonomous, but she also needs them to be cross-functional. Teams that can get a whole project done.

“What team are you on?” If he or she responds by mentioning the product they’re working on (say automation or integration) rather than their specialty (such as network engineering), she nods approvingly. When a specialist identifies with their specialty more than with the product they’re actually making, Dourambeis knows she still has work to do.

Whenever there are handoffs between teams, there is the opportunity for disaster.

“Secret Weapon: High-value Target Teams as an Organizational Innovation,” laying this out. … as soon as the near-failure in Iraq was averted, bureaucratic support for interagency teams began to decline. By 2008, other departments and agencies, particularly one unidentified intelligence agency, began pulling back people and cooperation, believing information-sharing and collaboration had gone too far.7

Once the teams grew larger than eight, they took dramatically longer to get things done. Groups made up of three to seven people required about 25 percent of the effort of groups of nine to twenty to get the same amount of work done.

Our brains simply can’t keep up with that many people at once. We don’t know what everyone is doing. And we slow down as we try to figure it out.

Just as on a Special Forces team, everyone on a Scrum team has to know what everyone else is doing. All the work being done, the challenges faced, the progress made, has to be transparent to everyone else.

Often, the team socially and functionally breaks into sub-teams that begin working at cross-purposes. The cross-functionality is lost. Meetings that took minutes now take hours.

“How can we do what we do better?”

“What is our biggest sticking point?”

We all perceive ourselves as responding to a situation, while we see others as motivated by their character. One amusing side effect is that when we’re asked to report on our personality traits and those of our friends, we always paint ourselves as far more boring.

Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process.

Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.

It reminds me of how much of a “default position” it is for people to start looking for someone to blame for a problem rather than search for a solution.

nothing gets moved to Done unless it can be used by the customer.

interfering and distracting the team slows its speed dramatically.

What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint? 2. What will you do today to help the team finish the Sprint? 3. What obstacles are getting in the team’s way?

Are all the tasks going to be completed on time? Are there opportunities to help other team members overcome obstacles?

The thing that cripples communication saturation is specialization—the number of roles and titles in a group. If people have a special title, they tend to do only things that seem a match for that title.

My standard speech to teams large and small is: “Do you really want to suck forever? Is that what your motivation is in life? Because it’s a choice, you know—you don’t have to be that way.” A team has to demand greatness from itself.

Think about your job. How much of your time is wasted while you’re waiting for someone else to finish their work, or for information to be delivered, or because you’re trying to do too many things at once?

Only a sixth of any of the work done actually produces something of value.

“Waste is a crime against society more than a business loss.”

Perceptions of the ability to multi-task were found to be badly inflated; in fact, the majority of participants judged themselves to be above average in the ability to multi-task. These estimations had little grounding in reality. Thus, it appears that the people who are most likely to multi-task and most apt to use a cell phone while driving are those with the most inflated views of their abilities.

If something is half done at the end of the Sprint, you’re worse off than if you hadn’t started at all. You’ve expended resources, effort,

and time and gotten nothing to a deliverable state. You have a half-constructed car. It might have been better to create something

How many days of inventory should a car company work toward? The industry standard is about sixty days—less

The problem is that too much inventory is pretty much the same thing as work in process. If you’re tying up a huge amount of value in things that aren’t delivering value, you won’t have those resources to do other things—such as market more, or push more sales, or explore new ideas. You have to have some inventory; the key is to minimize it.

Jobs that aren’t done and products that aren’t being used are two aspects of the same thing: invested effort with no positive outcome. Don’t do it.

Why did it take the Europeans so long? And why so many defects? BMW isn’t exactly known for making crappy cars. Here’s why: In a Toyota plant when a problem shows up on the line, every worker has the ability to stop the whole line. When that happens, everyone swarms around where the line stopped—not to yell at the guy for stopping the line, but to fix whatever problem is there. They don’t want any cars coming out the other end with things that have to be fixed. They fix the problem once, and it’s solved forever. If they don’t, that same defect could go into hundreds of vehicles. At European luxury-car makers there was a different way of doing things. At the end of the production line were dozens of people in white lab coats going around fixing all the problems. They made sure the car door had that BMW clunk when the door closed, or the engine purred with exactly the right tone. They made sure all the parts meshed together properly. They viewed themselves not as manufacturers but as craftsmen, artisans making a thing of beauty.

You read that right. The Germans spent more time fixing a car they’d just made than the Japanese did making one in the first place. There’s a reason Toyota became the number one car manufacturer on the planet. They did it right the first time.

It took twenty-four times longer. If a bug was addressed on the day it was created, it would take an hour to fix; three weeks later, it would take twenty-four hours. It didn’t even matter if the bug was big or small, complicated or simple—it always took twenty-four times longer three weeks later.

Overworked employees get more distracted and begin distracting others. Soon they’re making bad decisions.

Who cares how many hours someone worked on something? All that matters is how fast it’s delivered and how good it is.

The first is “Absurdity.” You want to give your team challenging goals—to push them to reach for more. But you don’t want them striving for absurd, impossible goals. The second is “Unreasonable Expectations.” How

A team that depends on regular heroic actions to make its deadlines is not working the way it’s supposed to work. Constantly moving from one crisis to the next causes burnout, and it doesn’t allow for reasoned, continuous improvement.

Ohno called the third type of waste “Overburden.” It’s the sort of behavior that Scott Adams regularly lampoons in his Dilbert cartoons. It includes onerous company policies that get in the way, unnecessary reporting that has people filling out forms for the sake of filling out forms, and meaningless meetings that suck up time and don’t deliver any value.

Assholes often justify their behavior by claiming they’re simply trying to make people work better. But they’re merely indulging the negative aspects of their personality, and nothing is more undermining of a team’s ability to excel.

What Scrum does is focus us on trying to eliminate the pointless waste that seems part and parcel of work.

Multitasking Makes You Stupid.

Half-Done Is Not Done.

Do It Right the First Time.

Working Too Hard Only Makes More Work.

Don’t Be Unreasonable.

No Heroics.

Enough with the Stupid Policies.

No Assholes.

Strive for Flow.

They’ve set up a system that forces them to endorse a fantasy.

As Sushil Bikhchandani, David Hirshleifer, and Ivo Welch, the authors of the paper “A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades” put it: “An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an individual, having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behavior of the preceding individual without regard to his own information.”2

People assume other people are making sound judgments, even if those judgments contradict their own.

if someone is good-looking, everyone assumes that they’re also smart and trustworthy.

the team just adds them all up and takes the average (in that case 6.6) and moves on to the next item. Remember, we’re talking estimates, not ironbound schedules. And estimates on small pieces of the project. If people are more than three cards apart, then the

high and the low cards talk about why they think what they do. Then everyone does another round of Planning Poker. Otherwise they just average the estimates,

It’s crucial, though, that you have the team who’s actually doing the work do the estimating, not some expert “ideal” estimators.

Or if you’re the manager, you might be astounded that your people don’t understand immediately that you’re looking at closing down small stores and opening up big ones. The problem is that you’re not getting, or giving, enough information to actually do the job right. People think in narratives, in stories. That’s how we understand the world. We have an intimate grasp of characters, desires, and motivations. Where we get into trouble is when we try to abstract out of the main through-line discrete parts and deal with them out of context.

So the first thing you want to think about when you’re considering a task is character or role—for example, a customer, a bride, a reader, an employee. Who is this task being done for?

Then you need to think of the what—what we want done in the first place. This is usually where we start and stop.

Finally, you need to think of motivation. Why does this character want this thing? How is it going to serve and delight this particular customer? And, in a way, this is the key part.

So before you prioritize what needs to be done for your business, you need to define the character, the user, the customer—the person who’s going to use what you’re

Often, needs will change with different characters. Imagine, for example, a story with the back two-thirds: “…  I want a car so that I can drive to work.” Now, if you start that sentence with “As a suburban commuter …” versus “As a farmer in the South Dakota Badlands … ,” you are going to end up with a very different interpretation of what the ideal vehicle is.

going to do. You need to know their likes, dislikes, passions, enthusiasms, frustrations, and joys. And then you need to understand their motivations.

Remember, the team decides how the work will be accomplished, but what will be accomplished is decided by business value.

When you’re writing stories or making a list of work to be done, it’s important to ask two questions: Is the story ready? And how will you know when it’s done?

Independent. The story must be actionable and “completable” on its own. It shouldn’t be inherently dependent on another story.

For each story pursued there should be both a “definition of Ready” (as in “Does it meet the INVEST criteria?”) and finally “a definition of Done” (as in “What conditions need to be met, what tests need to be passed, to call it a wrap?”).

if the stories are really Done at the end of a Sprint, teams can double speed again.

company had to get rid of employees who couldn’t make the switch, he says—not because they were incompetent, but because they were hoarding information and knowledge for their own benefit, to ensure their own indispensability rather than helping the team and the company.

It’s great to go to the pub with your team and bond. But it doesn’t do the company a lot of good if that bonding doesn’t actually translate into better performance. There are a lot of people I hang with just for fun. With my team I want that social aspect to move directly into performance. And it does.

The key thing to remember is that you’re not seeking someone to blame; you’re looking at the process. Why did that happen that way? Why did we miss that? What could make us faster? It is crucial that people as a team take responsibility for their process and outcomes, and seek solutions as a team. At the same time, people have to have the fortitude to bring up the issues that are really bothering them in a way that is solution oriented

On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the company? 2. On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a whole? 3. Why do you feel that way? 4. What one thing would make you happier in the next Sprint?

How can you prove you’ve made that improvement? You need to define what success is in a concrete, actionable way, so that in the next Sprint Retrospective it’s really easy to see if you achieved the kaizen.

for instance, a drop in happiness precedes a drop in velocity or productivity by weeks. If you were only looking at productivity, you wouldn’t know that there was a problem until it dropped off a cliff. But if you see a team-wide drop in happiness, even as productivity is increasing, you know you have an issue that you need to address, and soon. 

What are the things that actually make people happy? They’re the same things that make great teams: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Or to say it more expansively, it’s the ability to control your own destiny, it’s the feeling that you’re getting better at something, and it’s knowing that you’re serving something bigger than yourself.

Any stakeholder can observe a Daily Stand-up or attend a Review.

As I’ve said before, I’m not very interested in individual performance; I’m only interested in team performance. I can double a team’s productivity in a month, but an individual? That could take a year.

Atomizing people into informational silos simply slows everyone down. Plus, it breeds suspicion and distrust. It divides a company into the big boys who know stuff and the peons who merely execute segments of some mysterious agenda they aren’t capable of understanding. Bullshit. If you can’t trust the people you’re hiring to be on board with what you’re doing, you’re hiring the wrong people, and you’ve set up a system that has failure built in.

that. I want everyone in the company to be aligned with a unified purpose.

Delivering Happiness. Tony writes about the unique culture at Zappos, which is based on creating “Wow!” moments for customers. It turns out that to make customers happy, you want happy people on the other end of the phone.

Their research shows that the more connected people are to other people at work, the

happier they are—and, apparently, the more productive and innovative as well. So the company execs have set out deliberately to create these connections—not only on one team, or in one department, but across the whole company. And not just between people at one level, but between different levels, everyone from VPs to Accounts Receivable clerks. They do this through means both simple and complex. For example, they physically encourage chance encounters. Their building has many exits, but they’re all closed, save one, forcing people to go in and out through one door. The idea is that by having people bump into one another, they’ll more likely create, and nurture, those connections.

For four weeks each employee is brought up to speed on how the company works, but also on how the company’s culture works. It is really the second screening within the Zappos hiring process. Even after getting the job offer, you have to prove that you can absorb the culture. The results, says Foley, are remarkable. “Those connections [employees] made during boot camp stay with them throughout their careers.”

For four weeks each employee is brought up to speed on how the company works, but also on how the company’s culture works. It is really the second screening within the Zappos hiring process. Even after getting the job offer, you have to prove that you can absorb the culture. The results, says Foley, are remarkable. “Those connections [employees] made during boot camp stay with them throughout their careers.”

Say a job in HR is posted, and someone in accounting, who has always thought he might like that kind of work, sees it. That person who is curious about HR might then be brought into an “apprenticeship.” It gives the employee the chance to see if he really does like that work, and it gives the manager a chance to see if he’d make a good fit with the team.

Imagine how much more productive a company would be if everyone worked together toward a common goal.

is in their call center. That’s because they fire people who aren’t passionate about delivering for customers. Zappos sees those people as the public face of the company, and its standards are high. Folks at Zappos are flexible on a lot of things, but not on that.

It becomes obvious where the roadblocks are, where the waste is. When I run a company, I tell those people with “miser” habits that they don’t have the luxury of holding the team and the company hostage. They can either change their mind-set or go work for someone else.

What can companies do to create an atmosphere in which people thrive? Managers can encourage autonomy by letting people make their own decisions about their job. And they can make sure that employees know everything that’s going on, because, as they put it, “Doing your job in an information vacuum is tedious and uninspiring.” Managers should also have zero tolerance for incivility and never allow an employee to

poison corporate culture through abuse or disrespect. And, finally, they should give quick and direct feedback.

This complacent attitude often reveals itself with a comment such as the following: “We deserve to coast; we’ve earned it.”

So how do you pop the bubble before your players embarrass their country on live TV in front of billions of people? The first step is being aware of the problem, which is why I want teams to measure their velocity every Sprint. I want to know what their rate of change is. If there isn’t positive growth, I know we’ve got to bear down. And the person I depend on to do this is the Scrum Master. He or she needs to be able to see the problem and bring it

up with the team. It’s crucial that someone ask the hard questions. What you really want is a “Wise Fool.”

The “Wise Fool” is the person who asks uncomfortable questions or raises uncomfortable truths. These workers aren’t always easy to have around, since they can be seen as troublemakers or not part of the team, but they need to be cultivated and used.

One of Scrum’s virtues is that it makes the uncomfortable visible,

quickly.

They wait too long to get actionable feedback from the market, and from each other.

People tend to fall into four types according to Ben-Shahar. The first type, the “Hedonist,” is someone who is doing what makes them happy right now. Tomorrow? Let tomorrow worry about tomorrow. I’ll just enjoy today. I see this kind of behavior a lot in start-ups: a bunch of people in the figurative garage just making stuff, because it’s cool and it’s fun. But there isn’t a lot of attention paid to creating a sustainable product. Very little mental energy is channeled into how this thing will be working in a month, let alone a year down the road. And what usually happens is that the investors in these guys get worried. So they hire a bunch of managers to ride herd on the hackers. And, suddenly, the hackers

find that the world they enjoyed so much now sucks. There are now all sorts of rules and tests and reports. It sucks today, and they think it will suck forever. Call them now the “Nihilists.”

It’s that top layer that Maslow was most interested in, and that Scrum focuses on: helping people achieve personal growth and fulfillment.

People high up on that pyramid are not only happier and more fulfilled, they’re more effective and innovative.

Quantify Happiness. It’s not enough just to feel good; you need to measure that feeling and compare it to actual performance. Other metrics look backward. Happiness is a future-looking metric.

Make Work Visible. Have a board that shows all the work

that needs to be done, what is being worked on, and what is actually done. Everyone should

see it, and everyone should update it every day.

Pop the Happy Bubble. Don’t get so happy that you start believing your own bullshit. Make sure happiness is measured against performance, and if there is a disconnect, be prepared to act. Complacency is the enemy of success.

If a company isn’t making money, you don’t have a successful venture; you have a hobby.

The idea behind the Backlog is that it should have everything that could possibly be included in the product. You’re never going to actually build it all, but you want a list of everything that could be included in that product vision.

The trick of Scrum is figuring out how you build that 20 percent first. In traditional product development, teams don’t know what that 20 percent is until they deliver the whole thing. That means that fully 80 percent of their effort is waste.

the difficult part isn’t figuring out what you want to accomplish; it’s figuring out what you can accomplish.

An individual’s responsibility for leadership is not dependent on authority.… the deep-rooted assumption that authority should equal responsibility is the root of much organizational evil. I believe misunderstanding around this issue is rampant, problematic, and runs so deep in our consciousness that we don’t even realize it.

When you’re picking a Product Owner, get someone who can put themselves in the mind of whoever is getting value from what you’re doing.

The Product Owner is accountable for translating the team’s productivity into value.

The Product Owner needs to know the market well enough to know what will make a difference.

Two, the Product Owner has to be empowered to make decisions.

The battle was decided not by what the machine could do, but by how fast observation was translated into action. The MiG would take one action, the American pilot would respond, and while the MiG pilot was trying to respond to that, the American pilot could take another action.

“Orient” is not just about where you are; it’s also about what outcomes you’re capable of seeing—the menu of alternatives you create for yourself.

The combination of Observation and Orientation leads to a “Decision,” which leads to “Action.” Then

Frederick II of Prussia, later to be called “the Great”: “He who will defend everything defends nothing.”

What’s great about this process is that it’s iterative: just “rinse

and repeat.” Once people have your product or service or change in their lives, they’ll tell you what the next most valuable things are. Then develop 20 percent of that, and deliver again. And again.

If you want any changes, it will cost you.” This after-the-fact billing has become the center of so much cost that companies and agencies have set up Change Control Boards. From a cost point of view, it makes sense. Limit the number of changes, and you’ll limit the cost associated with them. What the bean counters don’t realize is that they’re setting up a system that is designed to deny people what they actually want.

They’re trying to limit cost, but in

doing so, they’re limiting learning, innovation, and creativity. If you begin a project and realize a little way in that the real value, that 20 percent, doesn’t reside in the features you laid out—it lives in a different set of things you discovered in the process of doing the work—traditional project management is set up to stop you. It’s set up to stop delivering value faster.

the idea of “Change for Free.” In a standard fixed-price contract, just say changes are free. List all the functionality you expect; for example, if you’re building a tank, you want one that can go seventy-five miles per hour and shoot ten rounds a minute, has seating for four, has AC, etc., etc.—everything you think you need for that tank. The builder looks at that description and says, Hmm, making that engine, I’ll call that 100 points, the loading mechanism, let’s call that 50, the seating, 5, etc., on down the list. At the end there is a set number of points for each feature. Then every Sprint, the customer, who in this scenario is contractually obligated to work closely with the Product Owner, can change priorities completely.

The three most common types are market risk, technical risk, and financial risk. Or, to put it another way: Do people want what we’re building? Can we actually build it? Can we really sell what we’ve built?

Apple famously does this with all their products, often building a dozen fully functioning prototypes before

organizing a shoot-out to see which one is the best. This allows different ideas to be expressed quickly without a massive investment.

By putting incremental releases in front of customers quickly, you’ll find out what your customers value and what they’re willing to pay for. And if your first guesses were wrong, you can make changes. The most you can lose is the cost in time and energy of the few Sprints you invested—as opposed to the multimillion-dollar cost of building a huge complicated infrastructure, only to find out that, while people loved your product, they didn’t love it enough to pay for what it cost to make it.

“I figured out it was taking nine to sixteen months for people to internalize the Valve way of doing things. It took a long time for people to feel empowered,”

“Welcome

to Flatland”:

It’s our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have a founder/president, but even he isn’t your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products. A flat structure removes every organizational barrier between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them. If you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, that sounds like a lot of responsibility,” you’re right.2

They knew what they wanted it to look like, but they didn’t have the ability to implement it. “So we started mocking up what it could look like, and then we made a movie of how cool it would be. And we used that movie to recruit people to the project. We couldn’t code it, [so] we needed to recruit people who could.”

“When a company has optimized itself around innovation, they usually change in a fundamental way by eliminating internal structures and hierarchies, any internal structure,” says Greg. Valve operates that way all the time. They don’t wait to be forced into change by a crisis; they are constantly changing. It’s the day-to-day way they run the company.

Valve Handbook:

But hiring that many people simultaneously who weren’t acclimated to the Valve way of doing things caused problems. There were pockets of workers not making decisions in the traditional Valve way. They were telling other people what to do. And, most damning, not performing up to the high Valve standards. Normally, other team members wouldn’t tolerate that kind of behavior, but because everyone in the group was new, their peers didn’t have enough confidence in the Valve way to take action.

Greg and the other founders refrain from telling anyone what to do.

All men dream: but not equally.
