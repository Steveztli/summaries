# Win Forever

## The Zone

What happens in the 'The Zone' :

- People feel super confident
- Everything is in slow motion
- There's a lack of fear to fail
  
How to make it happen?
Know every aspect of your game which mean that you need to be well trained.

> Share experience about being in the zone and explain to your colleagues how it feels, try to help them experience it.

Always motivate the team.
You don't need to be the best player but you need to be playing the best.

> Me: like Arjen Robben who nearly knew only one action but he knew it so well that it was enough to be one of the best player of his generation

## Philosophy

1. Get a philosophy and keep it.
2. Get a positive approach of winning instead of fear to lose.

Every member in the team should think about the team and see them as a piece of OUR success.

They used a funny game to make people focus on what they decided was the most important objective for the team (eg: scoring points).
