# Everything is fkced

"A man should look for what is, and not what he thinks should be"
"Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid".

The pursuit of happiness plunges us head-first toward nihilism and frivolity. It leads us toward childishness, an incessant and in- tolerant desire for something more, a hole that can never be filled, a thirst that can never be quenched. It is at the root of corruption and addiction, of self-pity and self-destruction.
When we pursue pain, we are able to choose what pain we bring into our lives. And this choice makes the pain meaningfulâ€”and therefore, it is what makes life feel meaningful.
Because pain is the universal constant of life, the opportunities to grow from that pain are constant in life.

He didn't believe that people made rational decisions most of the time. He believed the oppo- site. He believed that people were emotional and impulsive and just hid it really well. He believed the Feeling Brain was in charge and nobody had quite realized it.

l that is required is that we engage it and find the value and meaning in it.
Pain is the source of all value. To numb ourselves to our pain is to numb ourselves to anything that matters in the world. Pain opens up the moral gaps that eventually become our most deeply held values and beliefs.
When we deny ourselves the ability to feel pain for a purpose, we deny ourselves the ability to feel any purpose in our life at all.

It must be an odd time to be a super-successful businessman.
On the one hand, business is better than ever. There's more in the world than ever before, profits are breaking all-time productivity and growth are doing great. Yet, meanwhile, inequality is skyrocketing, political polarization is ruining one's family gatherings, and there seems to be a plague of tion spreading across the world.
So, while there's exuberance in the business world, there's als a weird sort of defensiveness that sometimes comes out of where. And this defensiveness, I've noticed, always takes the same form, no matter whom it comes from. It says: "We're just giving people what they want!"

Freud was infamous because he was the first modern thinker to argue that it was the Feeling Brain that was really driving the Consciousness Car. Freud believed that people's insecurities and shame drove them to make bad decisions, to overindulge or to compensate for what they felt they lacked. Freud was the one who realized that we have cohesive identities, stories in our minds that we tell about ourselves, and that we are emotionally attached to those stories and will fight to maintain them

Give those people what they want. But giving people too many of the diversions they want is a dangerous game to play. 
For one, many people want stuff that's awful. 
Two, many people are easily manipulated into wanting shit they don't actually want (see: Bernays). 
Three, encouraging people to avoid pain through more and more diversions makes us all weaker and more fragile.

Plato wrote that extreme freedom can't be expected to lead to anything but a change to extreme slavery.
Democracies are designed to reflect the will of the people. We've learned that people, when left to their own devices, instinctively run away from pain and toward happiness. The problem then emerges when people achieve happiness: It's never enough.
Their desires grow in lockstep with the quality of their circumstances.
Eventually, the institutions won't be able to keep up with the with people's happiness, guess what happens. People start blaming the institutions themselves.
