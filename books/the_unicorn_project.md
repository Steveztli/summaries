Any engineers I have that are any good are always poached away by other teams.

“That would be great! Wow, I’m so excited, Maxine,” Randy says. “I never get senior engineers to work on these problems.

They’re lured away by feature work that customers see instead of working on boring infrastructure …

“Maxine, I’m looking forward to introducing you to the rest of the team. Our first staff meeting is next week.”

Immediately, she is mystified. She finds links to HR systems, network shares to company resources, links to the expense reporting system, payroll, timecard systems … She finds Microsoft Word and Excel and the rest of the Office suite.

Maxine has kept a daily work diary on her personal laptop for the last decade. In it, she tracks everything she’s worked on, how much time she spent on it, any interesting lessons she learned from it, and a list of things to never do again

the three metrics I care most about: employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and cash flow.

“When you put them all on one switch, you complected their value streams, all now having dependencies on each other that didn’t exist before. They must constantly communicate, coordinate, schedule, marshal, sequence, and deconflict their work. They now have an extremely high cost of coordination, which has lengthened lead times, decreased quality, and, in your story, led to a week-long catastrophe that significantly impaired the business, going all the way up to Steve,” Erik says with glee.

how about you tell us something that could make your lives a little easier?”

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, still has a culture that if a developer ever has a choice between working on a feature or developer productivity, they should always choose developer productivity.

2013 they were performing nearly 136,000 deployments per day. Interesting that these CEOs I mention all have a software background, isn’t it?

“Contrast that with the tragic story of Nokia. When their market was disrupted by Apple and Android, they spent hundreds of millions of dollars hiring developers and investing in rolling out Agile. But they did so without realizing their real problem: technical debt in the form of an architecture where developers could not be productive. They lacked the conviction to rebuild the foundations of their software systems. Just like at Amazon in 2002, every software team at Nokia was unable to build what they needed to because they were hamstrung by the Symbian platform.

They could have had twenty times more developers, and it wouldn’t have made them go any faster.

they keep working on the features because they’re afraid of slipping their dates. “Why? A century ago, when mass production revolutionized industry, the role of the leader was to design and decompose the work and to verify that it was

performed correctly by armies of interchangeable workers, who were paid to use their hands, not their heads. Work was atomized, standardized, and optimized. And workers had little ability to improve the system they worked within.

‘It is ignorance that is the mother of all problems, and the only thing that can overcome it is learning.’

“The opposite of the Third Ideal is someone who values process compliance and TWWADI,”

the huge library of rules and regulations, processes and procedures, approvals and stage gates, with new rules being added all the time to prevent the latest disaster from happening again. “You may recognize them as rigid project plans, inflexible procurement processes, powerful architecture review boards, infrequent release schedules, lengthy approval processes, strict separation of duties …

“Which brings us to the Fourth Ideal of Psychological Safety. No one will take risks, experiment, or innovate in a culture of fear, where people are afraid to tell the boss bad news,”

Erik says, laughing. “In those organizations, novelty is discouraged, and when problems occur, they ask ‘Who caused the problem?’ They name, blame, and shame that person. They create new rules, more approvals, more training, and, if necessary, rid themselves of the ‘bad apple,’ fooling themselves that they’ve solved the problem,” he says.

The leader must constantly model and coach and positively reinforce these desired behaviors every day.

“If it hurts, do it less often. That’s their reasoning.”

This is the opposite of the Third Ideal, where instead of improving the processes we work within, we blindly follow them, she thinks. And now the process has fully imprisoned us, sucking out all the joy from our daily work, pushing us ever further away from the Second Ideal.

We made a bunch of rules about how we needed to be separate from Dev concerns, you know, to protect the business from all those crazy, reckless developers. Each year, we used anything that went wrong as an excuse to create more and more rules to ‘make developers more accountable,’ which just slowed us down even more. What makes me so excited about the Rebellion is that we’re trying to undo all of that.”

Working with designers fascinates Maxine. Early in her career, the ratio of UX and designers to developers was 1:70. These days, great teams doing consumer-oriented products have ratios of 1:6

“Only 2.5 percent of the time required to go from concept to customers actually using the feature is spent in Development?”

“If you’re too busy to work with the technology teams, I’ll move you into a pure product marketing role, and you don’t have to move your desk. Right now, I need product managers who are working side by side with the teams who are building what will achieve our most important business objectives. If you still want to be a product manager, I’ll figure out how to clear your plate and get those other responsibilities assigned to someone else. “Don’t give me an answer right now,” Maggie says. “Think about it and let me know first thing Monday morning.”

Kurt starts the meeting, saying, “Every time we have an outage, we’ll be conducting a blameless post-mortem like this one. The spirit and intent of these sessions are to learn from them, chronicling what happened before memories fade. Prevention requires honesty, and honesty requires the absence of fear. Just like Norm Kerth says in the Agile Prime Directive, ‘Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the

situation at hand.’ “Let’s first start by assembling a timeline and gathering details on what happened. To help with the process, Maxine pulled together our production telemetry and logs, as well as our chat rooms,

The only rule is that you can’t say ‘I should have done X’ or ‘If I had known about that, I would have done Y.’

“My pleasure,” Maxine says, winking at Brent, projecting her laptop on the TV. “I’m choosing to start our timeline at 6:37 p.m., which is after Tom initiated the deployment, after all the tests passed but the app failed to start. The health indicators went red, and Tom was the first to notice. Tom, what exactly did you see?” “I was watching the logs scroll by in the deployment tool, and I saw the startup messages, as you’d expect, and then I saw a bunch of error messages and a stack trace,” he says, his face darkening, reliving the crisis.

Jupyter notebooks, Python, R, and Tableau.

“It’s so strange,” he says. “She thinks we pay developers just to type, instead of paying them to think and achieve business outcomes. And

“Almost all businesses fade over time, because any profitable operation will attract competitors. The economic logic of selling reductions in transactional cost is irresistible and inevitable,” he says. “Which is why Horizon 2 lines of business are so important, because they represent the future of the company. They may introduce the company’s capabilities to new customers, adjacent markets, or with different business models. These endeavors may not be profitable, but this is where we find higher-growth areas.

How much of getting business done here is impeded by your internal systems and processes?”

“Lastly, to everyone else, especially Steve,” he continues, “think carefully about how each and every

position you eliminate might disrupt flow, especially when you don’t have locality in decision-making, as embodied by the First Ideal.

“Those middle managers are your interface between strategy and execution,” he says. “They are your prioritizers and your traffic cops. We all have this ideal of small teams working independently, but who manages the teams of teams? It’s your middle managers. Some call them derisively the ‘frozen middle,’ but you’ll find that properly developing this layer of people is critical to execute strategy.

If we take random people out of a value stream, we could do as much damage

Maggie had taken extraordinary care to mitigate the “HIPPO effect” (or Highest Paid Person’s Opinion), referring to people’s unhealthy tendency to only care what the highest-level decision-maker thought.

“Every week we will create time for everyone in the company to learn. For two hours, everyone is expected to teach something or learn something. The topics are whatever you want to learn: cross-train in another silo or business unit, take part in our famous in-store training program, spend time in our stores or manufacturing plants, sit with your customer or our helpdesk, learn about Lean principles or practices, learn a new technology or tool, or even how to better manage your career.

The most valuable thing you can do is mentor or learn from your peers. And you can expect to see me there too. Learning is for everyone, and it is from there that we will create competitive advantage.”

Technology needs to be embedded in the business, not external to it or merely “aligned with it.”

Erik says. “Did you know that Steve keeps a book by his bed of the most important people in the company, so that he’ll always recognize them, even in a crowd at Disneyland. And did you know that you’re in it, as well as Kurt, Brent, and Shannon? A decade ago, only the top plant managers and store managers were in there. Now, there are engineers in there too.

“You’re so right, Erik. Small doesn’t beat big,” Maxine says. “Instead, fast beats slow. And fast and big will win almost every time. The Unicorn Project has shown us that.”
