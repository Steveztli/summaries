# Management 3.0

## Why things are not that simple

No matter what you plan for the system, it is not going to happen. The system you live in doesn't care about your plans.

#### Casual determinism

One action results to one outcome

#### Complexity theory

There are events like weather that are too hard to guess because there are too many parameters.

#### Reductionism

Cutting a problem into small pieces to be able to explain them one by one. 

Remark: This works well until a certain point: when is the next financial crisis?

#### Holism

A system can't be determined by all its parts alone, the system is the key in the interactions of its parts.

#### Constructionism

A system is the sum of all its underlying parts.

Remark: It's not because you understand all the underlying parts, you can understand why part A fails but not how to prevent it on a global level (eg: the human heart).

#### Hierarchical reductionism

Like Holism, not everything in a complex system can be explained by seeking for lower level causes. Each evel of the system have new properties.

Law of leaky abstractions:
> All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.
> _Spolsky_

Theory of constraints:
> Unified models of complex systems are impossible to create

Focus on adaptability not on predictability.

### About many managements theories
Real scientific theories would nout only identify some natural phenomena, but would also make assertions about observations in the real world.
They often are not "theories" but techniques.

## Agile Software Development

- Passionate about the product
- Be your own customer
- List of features (no plan, be able to stop when you want)
- Growing process

#### Agile manifesto

Individuals & interactions -> process & tools
Working software -> comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration -> contract negociation
Responding to change -> following a plan

## Complex System Theory

Importance of connection dot.

The other option is to have many silo's that reinvent the wheel (eg: biologist, physician, ... don't communicate with each others)

#### General system theory

A phenomenon is viewed as a web of relationships of elements, this requires interdisciplinary skills with a common language.
From elements to a dynamic organization of elements.

#### Cybernetics

Is also cross-discipline.
A system have a goal and interact with the environment through a feedback mechanism from evaluating, iterations, sensing (in a circular way).

#### Dynamica system theory

A system have many states, some are stable and some are not.
When a state never change or go back to its initial state after disturbtion, we call it stable or attractor.

#### Game theory

A system often compete for the same resources where the success of one depends partly on the choices made by others (eg: dating someone).

#### Evolutionary theory

A system adapts to the environment.

#### Chaos theory

Little change in the system can make huge differences later.
This emphasis that the behavior is unpredictable because a minor issue can turn into a major one.

Embrace uncertainty and change.

## The Information Innovative System

An __agent__ can actively organize and reorganize itself in a system, this requires energy.

Focus on innovation not on data because innovation is key to survival.
Innovation fosters on the edge of order and choas, it's bottom up, it is emergent not planned.

#### Innovation

1. Knowledge 
   - is continuous input of information can be tuned into innovation.
   - is always a network (people, neurons, ...) because the amount of knowledge per silo is less that the number of connections.

   Because most knowledge can't be written, it's REQUESTED that actors are willing to work together and share.

2. Creativity: diverging from conventions, giving new answers to old information. 
   Creation of things that are unique and useful.

Innovation is useless without implementation

##### Five steps to creativity

1. Preparation, understand the problem
2. Incubation, thinking of it
3. Intimation, changing perspective
4. Illumination
5. Verification

#### Motivation

Only agents can initiate interactions, develop knowledge, create and perform activities. 
All this requires motivation, that's why the main focus should be on agent.

`A manager needs to select people, set expectations, motivate and develop them.`

Creation of novelty requires the desire to diverge, to take risks, to defy convetional options and to be expose of being wrong.

#### Diversity

Many benefits: increase flexibility, resist though environments and feed innovation.
There's no average person in a diversity system.

`/!\ Managers often hire lookalike`

It's important to have a common ground and a same goal.

#### Personality

Virtues highly impact actors behavior and motivation, the system also needs virtues that are shared among its actors with some diversity.

> [Law of Requisite Variety ~ _Ros Ashby_](https://www.businessballs.com/strategy-innovation/ashbys-law-of-requisite-variety/)
> A system can be controller only if the controller is more or equally complex as the controlled.
> eg: Tools and process are controlled by humans.

## How to energize people

Creativity steps:
- Pre-conventional: no knowledge with to full creativity
- Conventional phase: knowledge constraints creativity
- Post-conventional: knowledge with full creativity

Creativity requires available information, knowledge, motivated people with a good mix of personalities.

Creativity can also be developed from the environment, that's the manager's role: 
- Safety, feeling safe to express ideas and asks questions
- Play, challenge people and foster creativity like any games
- Variation, routine kills creativity. The manager needs to find ways to break it, for example changing sprint names or meeting rooms
- Visibility, make creative work visible to foster a culture
- Edge, of your comfort zone. It has to hurt a little to be effective like any workout.

The manager is responsible for the environment their employees work in, give them what they need!
