# Dare to lead

## Introduction

Definition of a leader
```
Anyone who takes responsability for finding the potential in people and processes, 
and who has the courage to develop that potential
```

When writing, always keep in mind to `write what you need to read`

What stands in the way of becoming a leader:
* Avoiding though conversations, giving honest and productive feedback
* Not actively addressing fears and feelings that show up during change
* Diminishing trust caused by lack of connections and empathy
* Not taking smart risks or creating and sharing bold ideas to innovate
* Being defined by setbacks, disappointements and failures
* Too much shame and blame
* Fear to say something wrong
* Rushing into ineffective solutions instead of problem identification and solving.
* Organizational values that can't be taught, measured, and evaluated.
* Perfectionism and fear of letting people grow

## Part 1 - Rumbling with vulnerability

People who aren't getting their asses kicked in the arena on occasion, I'm not interested in or open to your feedback. There are plenty of people who will never be brave but who will spend all their energy judging those who dare greatly.

### Rumble tool

Get a one inch by one inch piece of paper and write down the names of the people whose opinions of you matter. Keep that list and take some time to share some gratitude to them, they are your `square squad`.
Those people should love you for your imperfections and vulnerability, don't take 'yes' people, take people that respect you enough to give you productive and honest feedback.

Trust is earned in the smallest moments. It is not earned through heroic deeds or highly visible actions, but through paying attention, listening and gestures of genuine care and connection.

There's no fake vulnerability. Fake vulnerability can look like a leader telling us that we can ask questions but not taking the tume to create the psychological safety to do it, or not offering a pause in the conversation for anyone else to speak at all. 
Leaders are also not shriking the responsibility of attending to the team's fears and feeling by oversharing and sympathy. 

`"Seek first to understand, then to be understood"`~ Stephen Covey.

#### Stealth intention:
"I can protect myself from rejecton, shame, judgement, and people turning away from me and thinking I'm a bad person".
Stealth intention is a self-protection need that lurks beneath the surfacea nd often drives behavior oustide our values.

#### Stealth expectation:
"They won't turn away from me and think I'm a bad person".
Stealth expectation always lead to disappointement, resentment, and more fear.

## Tasc approach

The Accountability and Success Checklist

- T - Who owns the taks?
- A - Do they have the authority to be held accountable?
- S - Do we agree that they are set up for success (time, resources, clarity)?
- C - Do we have a checklist of what needs to happen to accomplish the task?

We want people to share our commitment to purpose and mission, not to comply because they're afraid not to.

## Uncertainty
When we are managing during a time of scarcity or deep uncertainty, it is imperative that we embrace the uncertainty. We need to tell our teams that we will share as much as we're able when we're able.
We need to be available to fact-check the stories that our team members might be making up, because in scarcity we invent worst-case scenarios. We need to open up the room for rumbling aroung vulnerability.

## Easy learning

Easy learning doesn't build strong skills.
The trend in many organizations is to design learning to be as easy as possible. Aiming to respect their employee's busy lives, companies build training programs that can be done at any time, with no prerequisites, and often on mobile device. The result is fun and easy training programs that employees rave about but don't actually instill lasting learning.

Worse still, programs like these may lead employers to optimize for misleading metrics, like maximizing for 'likes' or 'shares' or high 'net promoter score' which are easy to earn when programs are fun and fluent but not when they are demanding. Instead of designing for recall or behavior change, we risk designing for popularity.

## Grounded conficence
Grounded confidence = Rumble skills + curiosity + practice

We're scared to have hard conversations because we can't control the path or outcome, and we start coming out of our skin when we don't get to resolution fast enough. It's as if we'd rather have a bad solution that leads to action than stay in the uncertainty of problem identification.

> If i had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend fifty-five minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about the solutions. Albert Einstein.

## Statements/questions to bring alignment

- Walk me through all of the assumptions you are working off.
- How did y'all come up with the schedule?
- What are y'all seeing as the goal of the training?
- Help me understand what you see as the benefit of this approach.
  
## Trust
In our joint experience, we've learned that trust is the one thing that changes everything. It's not a nice-to-have; it's a must-have. Without it, every part of your organization can fall, literally, into disrepair. With trust, all things are possible - most importantly: continuous improvement and sustainable, measurable, tangible results in the marketplace.

## Path for success
1. The level of collective courage in an organization is the absolute best predictor of that organization's ability to be successful in terms of its culture, to develop leaders, and to meet its mission.
2. The greatest challenge in developing brave leaders is helping them acknowledge and answer their personal call to courage. Courage can be learned if we're willing to put down our armor and pick up the shared language, tool, and skills we need for rumbling with vulnerability, living into our values, braving trust and learning to rise.
3. We fail the minute we let someone else define success for us. Like many of you, I spent too many years taking on projects and even positions, just to prove I could do it.
I was driven by a definition of success that didn't reflect who I am, what I want, or what brings me joy. It was simply accomplush-acquire-collapse-repeat.
