# The making of a manager

Why would someone not be motivated to do great work? One possible answer is that he doesn't have a clear picture of what great work looks like. Another possibility is that the role doesn't speak to his aspirations: he can, but he'd rather be doing something else. Or perhaps he thinks nothing will change if he puts in more effort - there will be no rewards if things improve and no penalties if they don't, so why bother?
The first step to addressing any concerns about lackluster work is diagnosing the people issues behind it. Is it a matter of motivation or skill? This doesn't have to be complicated. You can understand this through a series of conversations with your report.
First, discuss whether your expectations are align - does "great work" mean the same thing for both of you? Then discuss whether it' s a matter of motivation. If both of those don't resolve your concerns, then dive in to whether the issue is with skills.

## 1 on 1's
<ins>Discuss top priotiries:</ins>
What are the one, two, or three most critical outcomes for your report and how can you hep her tackle these challenges?
<ins>Calibrate what "great" looks like:</ins>
Do you have a shared vision of what you're working toward? Are you in sync about goals or expectations?
<ins>Share feedback:</ins>
What feedback can you give that will help your report and what can your report tell you that will make you more effective as a manager?

## Set clear expectations at the beginning
At the beginning, you should agree on what success looks like - whether for a given project or for a give time period - get ahead of any expected issues, and lay the foundation for productive feedback sessions in the future.
During this phase, make sure you address the following:
- What a great job looks like for your report, compared to mediocre or bad job
- What advice you have to help your report and get started on the right foot
- Common pitfalls your report should avoid

## Every major disappointment is a failure to set expectations
Tell them explicitly

Be explicit that you'd like to review the work twice a week and talk through the most important problems together. Tell him which decisions you expect to make and which he should make.
Managers who pop in out of the blue and throw down new requirements can breed resentment with their team.

It's impossible to expect perfection. We are only human. Failures will occur, projects will miss deadlines, and people will make mistakes. That's okay. Bit when these things happen, readjusting expectations as quickly as possible helps people recover from errors with grace. You demonstrate care and maturity when you preempt bigger issues down the road.
Whenever you find yourself deeply disappointed, or disappointing someone else, ask yourself: Where di I miss out on setting clear expectations, and how might I do better in the future?

I might feel accomplished in pointing out the problem, but that's not the point if it doesn't actually help him. The mark of a great coach is that others improve under your guidance. Maybe you'd like to see your reports dream bigger, accomplush more, or overcome the barriers that get in their way. The question that should always be in the back of your mind is: Does my feedback lead to the change I'm hoping for?

I've found helpful is to devote a single 1:1 every month to just discussing behavioral feedback and career goals.

When you do have a critical feedback to share, approach it with a sense of curiosity and an honest desire to understand your report's perspective. One simple way to do this is to state your point directly and then follow up with "Does this feedback resonate with you? Why or why not?"

At the end of a conversation, when you're not sure whether you've been heard, there are a few things you can do. The first is a verbal confirmation: "Okay, let's make sure we're on the same page - what are your takeaways and next steps?"
The second is to summarize via email what was discussed.
Writing can clarify the points being made as wel as be reread and referenced in the future.
The third tactic is to help the person hear the same message many times and from many sources. For example, try dedicating multiple 1:1s to talking about particularly tough areas of growth with your report. Gather and share 360Â° feedback when you suspect your message isn't landing.

## Feedback
###DOes my feedback lead to positive action?
1. Make your feedback as specific as possible
   Use clea examples that get at the why so it's easier for the recipient to know what you mean.
2. Clarify what success looks and feels like
3. Suggest next steps.
Often the easist way to help your report is to translate your feedback into action is to share you think the next steps should be. Be clear about whether you're setting an expectation or merely offering a suggestion.
Also, beware of overdoing this - if you're always dictating what should happen next, you're not empowering your team to learn to solve problems on their own. A softer approach is to ask your report "So what do you think the next steps should be?" and let them guide the discussion.

No more than three goals, three sections and three bullets points.

I can't think of a single influential leader who hasn't had to go out on a lumb and do something somebody else disagree with. Acjnowledge the disagreement respectfully then move on. "I recognize that you may not agree with my decision, but I'm asking for your cooperation in moving forward".

## Managing yourself

Ask your manager to help you calibrate yourself through the following two questions:
- What opportunities do you see for me to do more of what I do well? What do you think are the biggest things holding me back from having greater impact?
- What skills do you think a hypothetical perfect person in my role would have? For each skill, how would you rate me against that ideal on a scale of one to five?

Example of specific asks:
- One of the things i'm working on is being more decisive. How do you think I'm doing on that? Any suggestions on how I can do better here?

### How to do your best
- 8h or sleep
- Do something productive early in the day which motivates me to keep the momentum going
- I know what my desired outcome looks like before I start
- I have trust and camaraderie with the people I work with.
- I'm able to process information alone (and through writing) before big discussions or decisions.
- I feel like I'm learning and growing.

### Thoughts on my goals
Twice a year, I look back on the past six months and reflect on what I've gotten better at. Then I set new learning goals for the next six months.

- Write your thoughts about the week.
- Write your 3 to 5 goals for the next six months

## Meetings
Good meetings are simple and straightforward. You leave them feeling the same way every time:
- The meeting was a great use of my time
- I learned something new that will help me be more effective at my job
- I left with a clearer sense of what I should do next.
- Everyone was engaged
- I felt welcomed

There are only a handful of reasons for people to get together in person, so being crystal clear about the outcome you're shooting for is the first step to running great meetings.

### A great decision-making meeting does the following:
- Gets a decision made
- Include the people the most directly affected by the decision as well as clearly designated decision-maker
- Presents all credible options objectively and with relevant background information, and includes the team's recommendation if there is one
- Gives equal airtime to dissenting opinions and makes people feel that they were heard.

### A great feedback meeting  achieves the following
- Gets everyone on the same page about what success for the project looks like
- Honestly represents the current status of the work, including an assessment of how things are going, any changes since the last check-in and what the future plans are
- Clearly frames open questions, key decisions, or known concerns to get the most helpful feedback
- Ends with agreed-upon next steps (including when the next milestone or check-in will be)

### Preparation and good facilitation is key
- Produces manyu diverse, nonobvious solutions through ensuring each participan has quiet alone time to think of ideas and write them down (either before or during the meeting)
- Considers the totality of ideas from everyone, not just the loudest voices
- Helps ideas evolve and build off each other through meaningful discussion
- Ends with clear next steps for how to turn ideas into action.

## Hiring

One exercise I do every January is to map out where I hope my team will be by the end of the year. I create a future org chart, analyze gaps in skills, strengths, or experiences, and make a list of open roles to hire for.
You can do something similar by asking yourself the following questions
- How many new people will I add to our team this year (based on company growth, expected attrition, budget, priorities,...)?
- For each new hire, what level of experience am I looking for?
- Which specific skills or strengths do we need in our team (for example, creative thinking, operational excellence, expertise in XYZ,..)?
- Which skills and strengths does our team already have that new hires can stand to be weaker in?
- What traites, past experiences, or personalities would strengthen the diversity of our team?
  
### Describe your ideal candidate as precisely as you can
Write the job description yourself and be specific about the skills or experiences you are looking for.
Even within the same kind of job, the specific requirements can vary meaningfully from team to team.

### Show candidates how much you want them
When you decide to extend an offer, it's as much yuour job as it is the recruiter's to make the candidate feel that you want her to say yes. The more distance you create in the process- for example, letting a week lapse between communications- the more likely the answer is no.
After I deliver an offer, I try to check in with the candidate every other day to let her know that I'm thinking about her and that I'm excited to welcome her to my team.
I ask if she'd flike to talk through any questions, and sometimes we'll do lunch or dinner to discuss the role in more detail.
The more senior the candidate, the more critical your involvment is in the close because that person likelyu has many options and you are looking for her to play a leadership role withing your team.
Paint a vivid picture of how you see her having impact. Help her understand why the role is exciting and whu she's the perfect person to tackle these big problems.

### Questions
1. What kinds of challenges are interesting to you and why? Can you describe a favorite proiject?
2. What do you consider your greatest strengths? What would your peers agree are your areas of growth?
3. Imagine yourself in three years. What do you hope will be different about you then compared to now?
4. What was the hardest conflict you've had in the past year? How did it end, and what did you learn from the experience?
5. What's something that's inspired you in your work recently?

## Process
Many people think of it as a bad word because it conjures up images of filling out paperwork or waiting in line. But process isn't inherently good or bad. Process is simply the answer to the question "What actions do we take to achieve our goals?"
Bad process is heavy and arbitrary. It feels like a series of hoops to jump through. But good process is what helps us execute at our best. We learn from our mistakes, move quickly, and make smarter decisions for the future.

Help, iumprove or enchance when talking about goals, they don't paint a clear picture. If someone on the team fixes one bug, does that "improve" the experience. Of course.
Would our team be happy if that's all we did in the next 6 months? No way. Because of the huge amount of subjectivity in words like help or improve, they don't do much to create a shared sense of purpose.
Instead, tangible visions have the most impact.
Ie: America's going to get wealthier -> A chicken in every pot.

At facebook, we weren't just trying to "grow and improve the service". We weren't even aiming to be the number one player in social networking. We held the idea in our minds that, one day, we'd build something useful enough that everyone - all the billions of people out there - would use it.
An inspiring vision is bold. It doesn't hedge. You know instantly whether you've hit or not because it's measurable. And it's easily repeated, from one person to the next to the next. It doesn't describe the how - your team will figure that out.

- Assume you have a magic wand that makes everything your team does go perfectly. What do you hope will be different in two to three years compared to now?
- How would you want someone who works on an adjacent team to describe what your team does? What do you hope will be your team's reputation in a few years? How far off is that from where things are today?
- What unique superpower(s) does your team have? When you're at your best, how aare you creating value? What would it look like for your team to be twice as good? Five time as good?
- If you had to creata quick litmus test that anyone could use to assess whether your team was doing a poor job, a mediocre job, or a kick-ass job, what would that litmus test be?

### Craft a plan based on your team's strengths

While many people on our team can, that doesn't mean we should. it's not our core competency and we'll probably end up spending double the time for 80 percent the quality of what a specialized team could do.
-> focus on doing a few things well

## Team's growth

Koch writes "Few people take objectives really seriously. They put average effort into too many things, rather than superior thought and effort into a few important things. People who achieve the most are selective as well as determined."

Effort doesn't count, results are what matters.

People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.  You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1000 things.

When ownership isn't clear, things slip through the cracks. This doesn't just happen in meetings; every time you send an email to more than one person about an issue that requires a follow-up, the recipients may be confused about whom you are expeting to take responsability.
Even when people have the best intentions, fuzziness around role definition can create problems.

Worry about what's in front of you- do'nt worry yet about what's months or years ahead. Then work with your team to set realistic and ambitious target dates for each milestone. Keep in mind the planning fallacy: our natural bias to predict that things will take less time and money than they actually do. Allot buffer for dealing with unexpected issues.

### Perfect execution over perfect strategy
The best plans don't matter if you can't achieve them accurately or quickly enough to make a difference. For example, say you had a crystal ball that could tell you the exact industry-disrupting idea to build. if your end product is slow and buggy compared to the competition, or if you fail to get to market fast enough, you'll still lost the game.

### Here are some ways to tell if your team is executing well:

- Lists of projects or tasks are prioritized from most to least important, with the higher-up items receiving more time and attention
- There is an efficient process for decision-making that every-one understands and trusts
- The team moves quickly, especially with reversible decisions.
- After a decision is made, everyone commits and moves speedily to make it happen. Without new information, there is no second-guessing the decision, no pocket vetoing, and no foot dragging.
- When important new inforamtion surfaces, there is an expedient process to examin if and how current plans should change as a result
- Every task has a who and a by when. Owners set and reliably deliver on commitments.
- The team is resilient and constantly seeking to learn. Every failure makes the team stronger because they don't make the same mistake twice.

## Define a long-term vision and work backward

If you don't know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else.

As a manager, part of your job will be the cultivation of such playbooks: how to run a team meeting, how to close a new hire, how to complete a project on time and on budget. If you find yourself doing a similar thing over and over again , chances are good that it can be codified into an instruction manual or checklist that can make the task go smoother in the future.
Another bonus of doing this: you can then pass the playbook to others to learn and execute.

What I learned is that it didn't matter how I saw myself. When people don't know you well and see that you're in a position of authority, they're less likely to tell you the ugly truth or challenge you when they think you're wront, even if you'd like them to. 

At higher levels of management, the job starts to converge regardless of background. Success becomes more and more about mastering a few key skills: hiring exceptional leaders, building self-reliant teams, establishin a clear vision and communicating well.

The end goal of management is to get better outcomes. When someone isn't a great fir for his role, there is a cost. Would you rather pay it by making a hard move or by passing it on to other team members and customers?
Assume the role was open. Would you rather rehire your current leader or take a gamble on someone else?

### Delegate

Consider the unique value you're able to add when it comes to the organization's top priorities.
Some of that flows from your personal strengths. For example, I'm a ggood writer, so over the years I've used that skill to help our team document and share its values - from authoring career guidelines and interview playbooks to putting out internal notes on lessons we've learned in building products.

## Culture
Whenever I ask prospective candidates if they have any questions for me, inevitably we get to talking about culture: "What's unique about your team?", "What are the best and worst part of your job?", "How are decisions made?", "If you could change one thing about the way the company works, what would that be?"
A manager I admire once told me that an organization's culture is best understood not from reading what's written on its corporate website but from seeing what it's willing to give up for its values.

### Understanding your current team

- What are the first three adjectives that come to mind when describing the personality of your team?
- What moments made you feel most proud to be a part of your team? Why?
- What does your team do better than the majority of other teams out there?
- If you picked  five random members of your team and individually asked each person, "What does our team value?" what would you hear?
- How similar is your team's culture to broader organization's culture?
- Imagine a journalist scrutinizing your team. What would she say your team does well or not well?
- When people complain about how things work, what are the top three things that they bring up?

### Understanding your aspirations
- Describe the five top adjectives you'd want an external observer to use to describe your team's culture. Why those?
- Now imagine those five adjectives sitting on a double-edged sword. What do you imagine are the pitfalls that come from ruthless adherence to those qualities? Are those acceptable to you?
- Make a list of the aspects of culture that you admire about other teams or organizations. Why do you admire them? What downsides does that team tolerate as a result?
- Make a list of the aspects of culture that you wouldn't want to emulate from other team or companies. Why not?

### Understanding the difference
- On a scale from one to nine, with nin being "we're 100% there" and one being "this is the opposite of our team" how close is your current team from your aspirations?
- What shows up as both a strength of your team as well as a quality you value highly?
- Where are the biggest gaps between your current team culture and your aspirations?
- What are the obstacles that might get in the way of reaching your aspirations? How will you address them?
- Imagine how you want your team to work in a year's time. How would you describe to a report what you hope will be different then compared to now?

## Never stop talking about what's important
