She said, “After dining with Mr. Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest person in England. But after dining with Mr. Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest person in England.” Guess who won the election? It was the man who made others feel intelligent, impressive, and fascinating: Benjamin Disraeli.

Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences. Reduce how quickly and how often you nod. Pause for two full seconds before you speak.

CHARISMATIC BEHAVIOR CAN be broken down into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth.

Counteracting charisma-impairing physical discomfort is simple: Prevent Recognize Remedy or explain

When you’re choosing a location for a meeting, take comfort into consideration. Ask yourself what the temperature and noise level will be like.

Awareness is the second step in dealing with physical discomfort. Check in with your face from time to time; notice if it is tense. This is where the ability to stay present will help you yet again: the more present you are, the better your chances of noticing if your body language is showing tension. The third step is to take action. If you realize that something has created tension in your face, do something about it. Before others misinterpret it, try to remedy both the discomfort as well as the misinterpretation.

As you inhale, imagine drawing clean air toward the top of your head. As you exhale, let that air whoosh through you, washing away all worries and concerns. Pick an entity—God, Fate, the Universe, whatever

the impostor syndrome is worst among high performers.

For some, it has been a direct corollary of career progression—with greater responsibility comes greater internal doubt as the cost of failure gets higher and higher.

Any internal discomfort—either physical or mental—can impair how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you. Physical tension caused by something as simple as the sun in your eyes produces the same changes in body language as a more serious discomfort, like anxiety or irritation.

Destigmatizing an experience means reducing its power simply by understanding that it’s normal, common, and nothing to be anxious about or ashamed of.

handling any difficult experience is a three-step process: destigmatize discomfort, neutralize negativity, and rewrite reality.

It helps to think of others who have experienced what you’re going through, especially if you can think of a person who is like you, but maybe just a step or two ahead—a person you both relate to and admire.

hearing them tell you their tale of woe in person would be ideal, but even simply imagining them going through this experience and telling you about it can be very helpful. (Remember, your brain won’t know the difference.) Another way to destigmatize discomfort is to remind yourself that you’re not alone in this experience. With about 7 billion people on the planet, I can absolutely guarantee you that not just one but scores of people are going through the same thing at this very moment.

The next time an uncomfortable emotion is bothering you, try this step-by-step guide to destigmatizing: Remember that uncomfortable emotions are normal, natural, and simply a legacy of our survival instincts. We all experience them from time to time. Dedramatize: this is a common part of human experience that happens every day. Think of others who’ve gone through this before, especially people you admire. See it as one burden shared by many. You are part of a community of human beings experiencing this one feeling at this very moment.

Don’t assume your thoughts are accurate. Just because your mind comes up with something doesn’t necessarily mean it has any validity. Assume you’re missing a lot of elements, many of which could be positive. ♦ See your thoughts as graffiti on a wall or as little electrical impulses flickering around your brain. ♦ Assign a label to your negative experience: self-criticism, anger, anxiety, etc. Just naming what you are thinking and feeling can help you neutralize it. ♦ Depersonalize the experience. Rather than saying “I’m feeling ashamed,” try “There is shame being felt.” Imagine that you’re a scientist observing a phenomenon: “How interesting, there are self-critical thoughts arising.” ♦ Imagine seeing yourself from afar. Zoom out so far, you can see planet Earth hanging in space. Then

Let’s imagine that traffic is making you late for an important meeting and your anxiety level is on the rise. Ask yourself: What if this delay is a good thing? Repeat the question a few times, and watch how creative your mind can get with its answers.

To be charismatic, you must first learn to overcome the primary obstacle to charisma: internal discomfort.

When warming up for an important event, follow this checklist to prepare your internal state and maximize your charisma. ♦ Go over your schedule for the hours leading up to the event. Think about how the activities and

meetings you have planned will affect you. ♦ If you can, avoid any difficult encounters and aim for confidence- or warmth-boosting experiences instead. ♦ Create your own music playlist for the internal state you’d like to have. You could make one for energy and confidence, one that makes you feel warm and empathetic, and another that makes you feel calm and serene. This exercise is a lot of fun in itself, and you can add new songs as often as you’d like.
