# The Indicators false belief - part 1: What really matters?

## Foreword

I know that my thoughts are against the current flow of project management, please, just try to be open to it and see if we these ideas can challenge your beliefs.

Please also forgive my writting, English is not my mother language and it is one of my very first article.

## Introduction

Have you ever realized how much time statistics do you hear everyday?
Today, I decided to count how much time I heard a refencre about it, believe it or not, I ended up with XX references.

### The love of Statistics

The love of statistics comes from two main reasons.

First of all, we are raised to believe that numbers are objective, that we can fully rely on them because they can't lie to us, as opposed to the language. 

Secondly, we like them because it is straightforward to understand, with few numbers we can master what's the current or future situation in a glimpse. Even better, they are often presented in nicely rendered graphs with colors, lines or bars and that makes the data easily comparable.

### Complex systems

Most of us work in a large companies and our tasks are a only a tiny part of the big picture.
If very big companies exist, it is because they need to solve very sophisticated problems and this is because they are working on what we call: "complex systems".

> Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. For example: transportation or economic organizations.
> Wikipedia

## Reporting impacts on complex systems

It is very appealing to simplify the complexity of a situation by using statistics and choosing a few key indicators. Obviously, the dependencies will not decrease according to the selected data, so by only choosing a part of them, we conscientiously decide to not fully grasp it.

My point here, is not to say that what we choose to measure our progression is wrong by default, but that we need to be fully aware that we do not fully understand the system as a whole.

### Measurable or not measurable

This month I read a book called "Measures what Matters" by John Doerr, it is very interesting and I recommend you to read it, but it ironically gives great examples on how difficult it is to identify to track progress towards the achievements and sums up very well the dead end that we are heading to with the "only what is measurable matters" approach that is also promoted with the SMART goals.

Here is the first example of the book,

> Goal: build a planning model for Google, as measured by three key results:
> Key result 1: I would finish my presentation on time.
> Key result 2: We’d create a sample set of quarterly Google OKRs.
> Key result 3: I’d gain management agreement for a three-month OKR trial.

This is in my opinion a very poor way to measure your progress as the quality of the actions, that could be assessed via feeback or reflection, is totally excluded from this approach. 

Building a planning is not a goal in itself.
The real objective is improve the company efficiency and one way to achieve it, might be to use a new planning system.

So why was the initial goal only focused on the action and not the results? Because it is already very complicated to track all the links between every actions without including the quality of the goal.

Only focusing on actions: 
- How do we measure the company efficiency? 
- How de we measure on much can the planning have an impact on the efficiency?
- What if the planning indirectly impacts another part of the system?

Please, note that the quality is also eluded in the key results because finding a way to objectivly know if the presentation is great is too complex we decide to shortcut it to "done -> success". 

You might want to argue that it is simplified example because it is the first one of the book.
Alright, the reality is that almost everything that we try to measure are simplified and wrongly measured due to shortcuts we are forced to take because it would takes us way too long to identify all parts of the system and to track them well.

### Why do we like unaccurate indicators

I will probably disapoint you, but the main reason is... because we have nothing better as of now.
It is better to have unaccurate data than having no data at all, and they are sometimes called for a reason, and it is the same reason that we don't call them: proofs.

I just want to put emphasizis what they are, and what they are not. Just remember it.

We also like them because it makes our choice a bit more objective and it gives us a sense of control over what we do.

### Improve your reports

One way to improve your knowledge on the system is to talk to the people in that system.

To understand the numbers better, I would advice everyone reading statistics to talk with the people who reported it, 
- What's their gut feeling? 
- How is the data collected? 
- What is missing?
- ...

To paraphrase my Master Yoda: Always two they are, no more, no less.
You need the deep narrow objective view of the numbers and broad general subjective overview of the words.

My last advice is to embrace the complexity, do the most to reduce it but always keep in mind that you will have to deal with uncertainty.

## Choosing your indicators

### 


QUestion is statistics = indicators: ok?



# On Reporting - Size does not matter
After many years and jobs in ICT, I have come across many organizational problems and very few solutions. 
Here is my thought on why we struggle to fix it. 

## People refuses good solutions
First of all, you might think that the main reason is that people refuse to change, however I would argue that when the change is worthed, it becomes fastly obvious and mostly everyone adapts to it.
*Look for topics about website

So what else could it be?

## How we are reporting

### Our classical reporting system isn't accurate

For me, it mainly comes from the way we report problems.

We created many ways to measure performance, issues, results,... but do we reflect on how useful and accurate are those measures?
Did we not lose track of the initial goal in the way of making things measurable?

According to me, relying too much on measures has side-effects and one of them is that the numbers starts to matter more than the reason why we decided to implement them.

In my career, I have been in many companies which decided to implement a ticketing service system to track the performance of their support.
Have you also noticed that after a few months of the implementation, the service quality decrease?
This is because instead of focusing on solving your problem, the support team is more interested in the statistics generated by the tickets.

You know the feeling:
- in which category relies my request?
- Waiting days or weeks to get a reply
- Status might be set to done without getting any proper solutions
- ...

I'm convinced that if these changes would bring benefits to the customers, you wouldn't have to complain about them sending dm's to your service.

You might argue that the solution is to add a feedback form where you ask if the customer got a decent solution and this is just pushing the problem a bit further, for exemple: the solution might be decent but came too late.

Let me be clear on this: I took the ticketing service as an example, but it is the same for any reporting where the numbers becomes too important.
This falldown also comes with Agile when velocity is more valued than building the right thing.

### Are numbers wrong by nature?

No, numbers are objectives but it is an abstraction that is hiding the reality, a simplification that doesn't tell what is going on.
It is often or too precise, or not precise enough.

My advice would be to keep using them, but beware of their limits and don't rely too much on them.

### How to understand the problem more precisely

No fancy rocket science here, back to the basics, back to the human relations.

Talk to your customers, talk to your colleagues, get their feedback, understand their struggles and listen to their ideas.
Learn, try and improve.

No measures and data will ever replace the people fighting the arena.

My point was that if you rely on
anonymous surveys and prescribed questions, you will not get quality
information. If you want to know what people are thinking, there is no good
replacement for simply asking them, best of all face to face

If he does
succumb eventually and accepts his new role in life, he will come to understand
that, as another testimony put it, “The entire job of middle management is to
ensure the lower-level people hit their ‘productivity numbers’ ”—and will
therefore start coming up with formal statistical metrics that his underlings can
try to falsify.

For too large numbers you need stats, but try to avoid when you can and add as much nuance as possible, dont cut the world in 2
